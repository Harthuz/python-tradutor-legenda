1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,933
Ah. Synclaire, sit still.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,733
Are you absolutely sure
we have to do this?

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,000
I mean, the hair is so fine,
you can barely see it.

4
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:15,166
We either gonna wax it
or put it in corn rows.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,933
Ow!

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,966
I don't know why we go
through this torture.

7
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:23,366
Every week, it's yank
this, shave that.

8
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:26,633
I can't wait to get married
so I can just let myself go.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,166
All this for men we
don't even have.

10
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:31,513
You think there
are men out there

11
00:00:31,537 --> 00:00:34,133
shaving their backs for us?

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,933
Well, now, ladies, to be fair

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm sure there are guys
out there going through

14
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:40,033
as many grooming
rituals as we do.

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,400
Like what?

16
00:00:41,466 --> 00:00:42,800
They trim their nails.

17
00:00:42,866 --> 00:00:45,266
With their teeth.

18
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:48,333
I say we should stop
mutilating ourselves right now

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,600
and just be happy the
way God made us.

20
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,700
I couldn't agree more.

21
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:54,433

That woman was buggin'.

43
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,040
I mean, who would go
into somebody's office

44
00:01:55,106 --> 00:01:58,073
in a business suit
with no drawers on?

45
00:02:03,313 --> 00:02:05,380
I mean, besides you.

46
00:02:06,246 --> 00:02:07,813
Hey, can I look now?

47
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,313
Synclaire, it's over.

48
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,280
Oh, good movie.

49
00:02:12,713 --> 00:02:13,913
[squealing]

50
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,280
Oh. Regine is home
from her date.

51
00:02:16,346 --> 00:02:18,679
Or you got rats.

52
00:02:18,746 --> 00:02:21,280
It's a little early for her to be home.
I wonder what's wrong.

53
00:02:21,346 --> 00:02:23,280
Only one way to find out.

54
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,022
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

55
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:31,180
What? Is it good?

56
00:02:31,246 --> 00:02:33,713
We got to be some lonely
heifers, spying on Regine.

57
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,080
[keys jingling]

58
00:02:36,146 --> 00:02:37,813
Oh, okay.

59
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,846
So, now, the piano
would be right here.

60
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,113
Hey, guys, this is Charles.

61
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,546
The Assistant DA, Charles.

62
00:02:48,613 --> 00:02:50,613
[chuckles] This is
Synclaire and Khadijah

63
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,980
my two roommates.

64
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:55,180
And this is their friend Max,
who just thinks she lives here.

65
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,680
Maxine Shaw from Evans
Bell and Associates.

66
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:01,853
Yes.

67
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,120
You know, I saw you try a case last week.
You're tough.

68
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,620
I mean, I thought you was
gonna actually hit the judge.

69
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:10,620
So did I.

70
00:03:10,686 --> 00:03:11,966
Well, it's good
to see you again.

71
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,153
Yes, yes.

72
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,820
I didn't recognize you at first.

73
00:03:14,886 --> 00:03:17,953
Well, that peephole makes
everybody look a little warped.

74
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,086
Yes, well, Charles,
you should be goin'.

75
00:03:21,153 --> 00:03:23,420
You've got a big trial in
the morning, remember?

76
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:25,486
The one you couldn't
stop talkin' about.

77
00:03:25,553 --> 00:03:27,620
Now, go. Smooches.

78
00:03:27,686 --> 00:03:29,286
Huh, are‐are we still
on for Saturday?

79
00:03:29,353 --> 00:03:31,453
Saturday, Sunday,
Monday, whatever.

80
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,986
Night‐night.

81
00:03:33,953 --> 00:03:35,953
Ooh, Regine, I like him.

82
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,920
He's sweet and thoughtful

83
00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:39,586
and his nose hairs
were neatly trimmed.

84
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,686
Yeah, I got to give
it to you, girl.

85
00:03:42,753 --> 00:03:44,386
Charles is a damn good attorney.

86
00:03:44,453 --> 00:03:47,386
Mm‐hmm. I wouldn't mind
a peek at his briefs.

87
00:03:48,886 --> 00:03:50,553
Yes, well, sorry to
disappoint y'all

88
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,820
but Charles ain't the one.

89
00:03:52,886 --> 00:03:55,753
But, Regine, he's got
money and status.

90
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,286
Technically, you
should be in love.

91
00:03:58,353 --> 00:04:01,926
I know, but Charles has
no <i>je ne sais quoi.</i>

92
00:04:01,993 --> 00:04:03,593
No <i>joie de vivre.</i>

93
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,460
No... oomph.

94
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:10,193
Girl, that's what we're for.
To cultivate them.

95
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,426
You see, a good man
is like fine wine.

96
00:04:14,493 --> 00:04:17,060
They all start out like grapes.

97
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:19,093
Our job is to stomp on them.

98
00:04:22,493 --> 00:04:24,973
And then keep them in the dark
until they mature into something

99
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:27,097
we wouldn't mind
having dinner with.

100
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:29,760
Yes, well, I can't
wait that long.

101
00:04:29,826 --> 00:04:32,360
I need my thirst quenched now.

102
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:36,459
Why you always have
to have a man?

103
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,426
Well, hey. Some people paint..

104
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:41,426
[laughing]

105
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:49,360
Now, to you, this may seem
like a simple burnt bagel.

106
00:04:49,426 --> 00:04:52,660
But we know it as the
handyman's nightmare.

107
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:55,160
See, one minute, just
toasting a bagel.

108
00:04:55,226 --> 00:04:59,060
Gets stuck, overheats,
shorts out the circuit.

109
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:01,733
Next thing you know, you
burn the building down.

110
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,366
Oh, well, I never
realized that toasting

111
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:06,433
was such a responsibility.

112
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,866
Not many people do.

113
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:12,600
Oh, Overton, is there
anything you can't fix?

114
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:15,066
Nope. That's why I put
an ad in the paper.

115
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:18,933
To expand my handyman empire
beyond this mere brownstone.

116
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:23,800
That's the last time I ask
you to go shopping with me.

117
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:26,000
You got to flirt with
every man at the market?

118
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:28,100
I got us this free
meat here, didn't I?

119
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:31,366
I'm telling you.

120
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:33,233
You and Regine are just alike.

121
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,100
Always trying to turn
some man's head.

122
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,633
Excuse me, Regine and
I are nothing alike.

123
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm just looking
for a good time.

124
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:40,300
She's looking for a sponsor.

125
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,613
Hey, what's up? I got the paper.

126
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:45,166
‐ Hey, Kyle. ‐ Damn.

127
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:47,600
These paper boys are
getting older and uglier.

128
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:52,300
Max, Max, yet another
thinly‐veiled attempt

129
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:54,866
to deny your animalistic
attraction towards me.

130
00:05:54,933 --> 00:05:56,100
[purrs]

131
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:02,406
You right about the
animal part, Fido.

132
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,206
‐ You want me so bad..
‐ Oh, my gosh.

133
00:06:07,273 --> 00:06:08,873
It hurts, don't it?

134
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,073
[chuckles]

135
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,040
Hey, man, you check out the ad?

136
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:13,946
Yeah, man, but I don't
think it's gonna get you

137
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,837
the response you wanted.

138
00:06:16,473 --> 00:06:19,406
"Expert handyman will
service your needs."

139
00:06:19,473 --> 00:06:20,740
Tell me that ain't good.

140
00:06:20,806 --> 00:06:22,473
[chuckles] Good for a laugh.

141
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,440
Man, they put it
in the personals.

142
00:06:24,506 --> 00:06:27,173
Your beeper number is in
the "Swingles" section.

143
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,706
[chuckles]

144
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:32,040
Right next to "Big,
buxom blonde"

145
00:06:32,106 --> 00:06:34,273
seeks same for fun and frolic."

146
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:36,706
(beeping)

147
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:40,873
I'm scared, Kyle.

148
00:06:45,506 --> 00:06:48,473
So, what is Mr. Lover Man doing

149
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,040
perusing the personals?

150
00:06:50,106 --> 00:06:53,073
[chuckles] Baby, I was looking
for a much‐needed date.

151
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,140
For you.

152
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,606
Yep, expert handyman
will service your needs.

153
00:07:00,946 --> 00:07:04,013
You want me to what?

154
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,980
I'm sorry, but shouldn't your,
uh, husband be fixing that?

155
00:07:08,046 --> 00:07:11,146
Maybe her husband's
not handy like you.

156
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,046
I said I'm sorry, lady,
but the ad was misplaced.

157
00:07:18,113 --> 00:07:20,780
And I'm sure we violating
some kind of FCC rule

158
00:07:20,846 --> 00:07:23,513
by talking like this.

159
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,880
Goodbye.

160
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,180
Hey, Regine. What's up?

161
00:07:30,246 --> 00:07:31,380
You look tired.

162
00:07:31,446 --> 00:07:34,913
Oh, I just gave Charles
his walking papers.

163
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,280
Ooh, it is such a drain

164
00:07:36,346 --> 00:07:38,180
breaking up with
someone delicately.

165
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:39,946
You know the routine.

166
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:42,380
"It's me. It's not you.

167
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:44,780
Of course, we'll
still be friends."

168
00:07:44,846 --> 00:07:48,746
Blah, blah, blah. Cry, cry, cry.
Hug, hug, hug.

169
00:07:48,813 --> 00:07:51,146
"Okay. Bye."

170
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,513
You dumped him?

171
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,213
Yep.

172
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,780
Any hard feelings?

173
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,420
Not on my part.

174
00:08:02,753 --> 00:08:05,453
‐ So Charles is free?
‐ Max, stop.

175
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,686
‐ What? ‐ I know that look.

176
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:10,286
That's the same look you gave
the butcher two hours ago.

177
00:08:10,353 --> 00:08:12,986
‐ Ouch! ‐ Don't
go after Charles.

[beeping]

179
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,053
Khadijah, relax.
Regine doesn't care.

180
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,486
Regine, do you care if
I give Charles a call?

181
00:08:23,553 --> 00:08:26,220
No, girl. Go ahead and call.

182
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:28,220
Why we got so much meat?

183
00:08:29,786 --> 00:08:32,920
Uh, ma'am, you breathing
kind of hard.

184
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:39,086
You wanna call me back after
you catch your breath?

187
00:08:51,253 --> 00:08:54,653
Girl, I am ready
for church today.

188
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,786
Take it from me, Khadijah.

189
00:08:55,853 --> 00:08:57,220
Never try to expand
your business

190
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,053
by putting an ad in the paper.

191
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,860
Still popular with
the pervs, huh?

192
00:09:00,926 --> 00:09:02,093
As ever.

193
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,426
Why don't you just turn
your beeper off, Overton?

194
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:05,426
Oh, sure.

195
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:06,760
The second I do that

196
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:09,526
that's when somebody's
tub overflows.

197
00:09:09,593 --> 00:09:12,226
Water drips through the
floor, lands on the stove

198
00:09:12,293 --> 00:09:14,026
puts somebody's pilot light out.

199
00:09:14,093 --> 00:09:17,160
Next thing you know the whole,
damn building done blowed up.

200
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,826
This is okay for church, huh?

201
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:24,260
That's between you and your God.

202
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,893
[knock on door]

203
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,626
Max. Alright, let's go.

204
00:09:29,693 --> 00:09:31,426
Actually, I'm not going
with y'all today.

205
00:09:31,493 --> 00:09:34,893
I'm going to church and Sunday
brunch in the park with Charles.

206
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,160
Charles?

207
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,493
Hey!

208
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,660
Both of you are dating
men named Charles.

209
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,626
You're just destined to be
a step behind, aren't you?

210
00:09:47,693 --> 00:09:50,193
Regine, you are okay
with this, aren't you?

211
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,226
[chuckles] I'm fine with it.

212
00:09:52,293 --> 00:09:53,626
Cool. Who's got the stockings?

213
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,593
Here you go. But can
I get the egg back?

214
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,760
I make Christmas ornaments.

215
00:09:59,426 --> 00:10:00,733
Okay. I'll see you.

216
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,166
Hey, Max, I thought
I'd find you here.

217
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,933
Hello, Regine.

218
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Hi, Charles.

219
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:21,666
Awkward moment, huh?

220
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:24,533
[chuckles] No.

221
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,733
Mm‐mm. No. Not at all.

222
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:30,933
Well, Max, uh..

223
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:32,933
You ready to go?

224
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,366
Sure. If you are. Let's go.

225
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:37,800
Say a prayer for me, huh?

226
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:39,033
Smooches.

227
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,766

Alright, girls. What we

Uh, wait a minute.

234
00:11:02,106 --> 00:11:03,673
You think you can just sashay

your man‐stealing
behind up in my house

236
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:07,540
you are sadly mistaken.

237
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,606
Is this about Charles?

238
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:15,573
Regine is pretty upset
with you, Miss Missy.

239
00:11:19,206 --> 00:11:21,373
So you just couldn't
wait to sink your claws

240
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,006
into my man, huh?

241
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:24,340
Your man?

242
00:11:24,406 --> 00:11:26,440
Regine, you chewed
him up, spit him out

243
00:11:26,506 --> 00:11:29,040
and told me to call him.

244
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:31,806
No, I did not tell
you to call him.

245
00:11:31,873 --> 00:11:34,573
I said you could call him.
Khadijah, you were there.

246
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,240
No, no, no, no. I ain't got
nothing to do with it.

247
00:11:37,306 --> 00:11:40,506
Your exact words were,
"Go ahead, call him."

248
00:11:40,573 --> 00:11:43,306
And you took that as a "yes"?

249
00:11:43,373 --> 00:11:45,440
Now, what are you getting
so worked up about?

250
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:46,606
You didn't even like him.

251
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,206
Well, that is not the point.

252
00:11:49,273 --> 00:11:51,806
The point is, you
broke the rules.

253
00:11:51,873 --> 00:11:53,540
You're supposed to
let it cool off

254
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:56,006
at least one‐third of
the total dating time

255
00:11:56,073 --> 00:11:59,106
or one month for each year,
whichever's shorter.

256
00:12:00,613 --> 00:12:03,546
If only you used your
powers for good.

257
00:12:04,646 --> 00:12:07,146
Regine, this is New
York in the '90s.

258
00:12:07,213 --> 00:12:09,546
The only rules about dating
are five locks on the door

259
00:12:09,613 --> 00:12:11,413
and keep the stun gun on
your side of the bed.

260
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:16,380
Please. Well, that's just the
dumbest logic I ever heard.

261
00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:18,146
No wonder you can't win a case.

262
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,746
I win plenty!

263
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:29,780
And at least I got a job.
What kind of job do you have?

264
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:31,480
Shopping.

265
00:12:32,813 --> 00:12:35,513
I am a buyer for a boutique.

266
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,580
Shopping.

267
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,046
Well, somebody needs to shop
for your non‐dressing behind.

268
00:12:41,113 --> 00:12:43,680
‐ Oh! This is ridiculous.
‐ Yeah!

269
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:46,146
I can't believe you're gonna let
a man affect our friendship.

270
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:49,046
No, I'm not, 'cause we
don't have a friendship!

[knock on the door]

272
00:13:04,186 --> 00:13:07,153
And the woman in 3‐B
thinks Max is right.

00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,753
Khadijah, can you
believe the way

274
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,886
Max is running behind me,
pickin' up my leftovers?

275
00:13:18,553 --> 00:13:22,920
I said can you believe Max

276
00:13:22,986 --> 00:13:26,320
up there running behind
me, picking up my scraps?

277
00:13:27,953 --> 00:13:30,653
Yes, well, I cannot believe it.

278
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:36,220
She is obviously a
desperate, desperate woman.

279
00:13:38,053 --> 00:13:39,553
So you're saying

280
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,786
what she's doing is okay
and that I'm wrong?

281
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:44,853
I ain't sayin' a damn thing.

282
00:13:46,286 --> 00:13:48,820
Yeah, well, somebody
has to talk to her.

283
00:13:48,886 --> 00:13:51,486
You're right. Go ahead.
I'm eating my breakfast.

284
00:13:51,553 --> 00:13:54,053
Oh, come on, Khadijah,
she'll listen to you.

285
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,453
I'm not the one with
the problem here.

286
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,020
It's never stopped
you any other time.

287
00:14:00,593 --> 00:14:03,393
Mornin'. I just had the
best night's sleep.

288
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,793
No coffee for me.
Thanks, don't need it.

289
00:14:10,493 --> 00:14:12,993
Shut up.

290
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,160
Regine, are you still
worrying over Charles?

291
00:14:15,226 --> 00:14:17,726
Mm‐mm! No! Not at all. Know why?

292
00:14:17,793 --> 00:14:20,360
'Cause when Khadijah talks
to Max, it will all be over.

293
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:23,026
Uh‐uh. I told you, I'm
not getting in this.

294
00:14:23,093 --> 00:14:25,126
Oh, come on, Khadijah.

295
00:14:25,193 --> 00:14:28,093
Don't you see how this
is making me unhappy?

296
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,260
Don't you care how
it's affecting me?

297
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:32,793
Nope.

298
00:14:34,326 --> 00:14:35,793
Come on, Khadijah.

299
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,693
How would you feel if Max were
dating your old boyfriend?

300
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,193
She knows better.

301
00:14:42,826 --> 00:14:44,193
See?

302
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,160
Exactly. Exactly my point.

303
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:48,260
Max, she wouldn't
do this to you.

304
00:14:48,326 --> 00:14:50,393
And what is wrong with me?

305
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,226
I mean, why is it that every
time I let go of a guy

306
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:56,460
he turns out to be Mr.
Right for somebody else?

307
00:14:56,526 --> 00:14:58,626
Regine, Charles has not changed.

308
00:14:58,693 --> 00:15:01,100
It's just that you always
want what you can't have.

309
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,166
And maybe this whole thing
is bothering you so much

310
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:05,300
because you're being
selfish and self‐centered.

311
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:07,466
Mm‐hmm.

312
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:12,100
I know what this is about.
It's all about me.

313
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:16,866
Uh‐huh. See, Max?

314
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:18,966
She don't care nothing
about Charles.

315
00:15:19,033 --> 00:15:21,900
She is using him to get to me.

316
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:24,466
She always wants what I have!

317
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:27,533
‐ Like what? ‐ Make a list.

318
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,800
Start with these.

319
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:33,733
Her hands?

320
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:41,166
Overton, you alright?

321
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:42,633
[panting]

322
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,666
Huh.

323
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:46,500
Alrighty, now, sip it
slowly and tell us

324
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:48,400
everything that happened.

325
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:54,433
Well, what happened was
I went on that call.

326
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,900
Miss Harper?

327
00:15:55,966 --> 00:15:58,233
The one with that
broken furnace?

328
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,906
I get over there and she lead
me down into a basement.

329
00:16:01,973 --> 00:16:05,540
Then she kicked off her
shoes, took off her robe

330
00:16:05,606 --> 00:16:08,673
and start talking 'bout,
"Light my fire, daddy."

331
00:16:11,073 --> 00:16:12,106
[knock on the door]

332
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,240
Good morning. Yo, Overton,
man, you know Miss Harper?

333
00:16:18,306 --> 00:16:20,906
I've seen her naked. Can't
say that I know her, though.

334
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:24,406
Well, she certainly knows you.

335
00:16:24,473 --> 00:16:27,173
She called with a list of odd
jobs she like you to take care.

336
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,273
And she said, if you don't come
to her, she's coming to you.

337
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,440
Um, just bury me in
my blue suit, man.

338
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:41,740
So, you're saying that
I am self centered.

339
00:16:41,806 --> 00:16:43,506
And self absorbed.

340
00:16:43,573 --> 00:16:47,206
Well, I am not! I happen
to have a problem.

341
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:50,706
And nobody and I mean
nobody sleeps in this house

342
00:16:50,773 --> 00:16:53,006
until my problem is solved!

343
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,313
I don't want to talk about
Charles no more, Regine.

344
00:17:03,246 --> 00:17:05,013
I understand, Regine.

345
00:17:06,413 --> 00:17:08,480
Get off the phone, Regine.

346
00:17:09,913 --> 00:17:11,213
I am your friend!

347
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:16,346
Look, just go blow your
nose, stuff your face

348
00:17:16,413 --> 00:17:18,446
and get over it, okay?

349
00:17:18,513 --> 00:17:20,280
Geez.

350
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:21,813
Synclaire, what are you doing?

351
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,046
I'm shredding those files
like you asked me to.

352
00:17:24,113 --> 00:17:25,880
Those files are on my desk.

353
00:17:25,946 --> 00:17:27,313
Oh.

354
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,546
Then we're gonna
need a little tape.

355
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,080
Hey, what are you up to?

356
00:17:32,146 --> 00:17:34,046
The usual.

357
00:17:34,113 --> 00:17:36,280
Max, my mellow, my
ace, check this out.

358
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,580
Lemme talk to you.

359
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:39,546
What's up with you and Charles?

360
00:17:39,613 --> 00:17:42,813
Nothing. I like the
guy, we have fun.

361
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,000
You got a problem with that?

362
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,680
No. Not at all.

363
00:17:47,746 --> 00:17:49,480
Break up with him.

364
00:17:49,546 --> 00:17:50,780
For Regine?

365
00:17:50,846 --> 00:17:52,146
No way.

366
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:54,446
I am not gonna let you
indulge that spoiled child.

367
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:57,213
I'm having fun and I'm not gonna
stop having fun just for her.

368
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,046
Regine is not going
to get her way.

369
00:17:59,113 --> 00:18:01,020
Not this time, no way! Uh‐uh!

370
00:18:01,086 --> 00:18:02,353
I'm gonna be the grown‐up here.

371
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,453
[snorts]

372
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:09,253
(woman over TV) '...three, and
four, and five, and squeeze'

373
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,186
'and seven, and squeeze.'

374
00:18:11,253 --> 00:18:13,786
'One more, now squeeze.'

375
00:18:13,853 --> 00:18:17,586
'And squeeze, and
squeeze, and burn!'

376
00:18:17,653 --> 00:18:19,986
'Good workout. And exhale!'

377
00:18:20,053 --> 00:18:21,653
[all exhale]

378
00:18:22,786 --> 00:18:23,820
'Next week, thighs.'

379
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:25,220
[doorbell rings]

380
00:18:26,553 --> 00:18:27,986
I'll get it.

381
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:35,086
Oh. Y'all pretending
to work out again?

382
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,186
Well, we can't all
be scrawny like you.

383
00:18:39,253 --> 00:18:40,253
Snipe away.

384
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,420
You're gonna feel real small

385
00:18:41,486 --> 00:18:43,220
after I tell you
what I just did.

386
00:18:43,286 --> 00:18:46,286
Did you start dating
somebody else's boyfriend?

387
00:18:46,353 --> 00:18:49,786
You won't believe how small
you're going to feel.

388
00:18:49,853 --> 00:18:52,186
For your information, I
just broke up with Charles.

389
00:18:53,386 --> 00:18:56,253
Have a seat, girl.

390
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,486
My girl, I knew I got to you.

391
00:18:58,553 --> 00:19:01,460
Hey, well, it was the
right thing to do.

392
00:19:01,526 --> 00:19:03,193
This is just wonderful.

393
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,700
All this time,
Khadijah's been saying

394
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,226
that you were petty, and evil

395
00:19:06,293 --> 00:19:09,493
and too selfish to ever
work this thing out.

396
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,026
I guess you proved
her wrong, huh?

397
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,026
Well, Max, I am shocked.

398
00:19:19,093 --> 00:19:20,726
I mean, it's not
often that a woman

399
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,693
does something nice for me.

400
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,460
So, when it happens,
it really stands out.

401
00:19:25,526 --> 00:19:28,326
Well, hey, it was nothing.

402
00:19:28,393 --> 00:19:29,793
Now, can we get on
with our lives?

403
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:32,126
I am so sorry

404
00:19:32,193 --> 00:19:35,060
that I made such a big
deal out of all this.

405
00:19:35,126 --> 00:19:36,593
But when Charles
took you to church

406
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,393
that really hurt.

407
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,360
I mean, it meant that
he took you seriously.

408
00:19:41,426 --> 00:19:43,793
The men in my life, they never
take me that seriously.

409
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,560
Maybe it's because I'm
a little superficial.

410
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,393
Immature.

411
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,593
Petty.

412
00:19:55,426 --> 00:19:56,993
Anyway..

413
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:04,900
I just want you to know
that I respect you, girl

414
00:20:04,966 --> 00:20:06,500
and I respect the way
you handled this.

415
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:09,033
I mean, the way you were
able to just let Charles go.

416
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,533
And the way you
came over here‐‐.

417
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,800
And lied through my teeth!

418
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,066
What?

419
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,066
Charles dumped me.

420
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:24,300
He gave me some tired,
"baby‐it's‐me‐not‐you" crap.

421
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:26,366
"We could still be friends."

422
00:20:29,133 --> 00:20:32,100
Oh, Max, I'm sorry.

423
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:35,100
Girl, you must be in
such pain right now.

424
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,133
Is there anything that I can do?

425
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,600
You can start by wiping that
silly grin off your face.

426
00:20:44,666 --> 00:20:46,066
Well, girl, look at
the bright side.

427
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,033
At least, now, you
don't have to endure

428
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,966
those sloppy kisses of his

429
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:53,700
where both of his lips are
on the outside of yours.

430
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,900
I liked those.

431
00:20:57,233 --> 00:20:59,353
What I couldn't stand was
that goo he put in his hair.

432
00:20:59,377 --> 00:21:02,284
He ruined my velvet sofa. I'm
sending the brother a bill.

433
00:21:03,373 --> 00:21:06,073
Well, I, for one, am glad
that Charles dumped you.

434
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,040
I mean, what would have
happened if he hadn't?

435
00:21:08,106 --> 00:21:10,240
I would have probably
kept seein' him.

436
00:21:10,306 --> 00:21:12,740
I would probably
have stole him back.

437
00:21:12,806 --> 00:21:14,249
I would have had to marry
him to keep him from you.

438
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,340
I would have had to‐‐.

439
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:17,706
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, yo.
Hold on.

440
00:21:17,773 --> 00:21:20,306
We not going to go
down this block again.

441
00:21:20,373 --> 00:21:22,040
Alright, alright.
You're right, Khadijah.

442
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:24,240
I'll tell you what, let's
make a rule right now

443
00:21:24,306 --> 00:21:26,273
that we will never
do this again.

444
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,640
Okay, from this point onward,
no occupant of this house..

445
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,340
Or friend of an
occupant of this house

446
00:21:35,406 --> 00:21:39,773
will date the ex or current
boyfriend of said others.

447
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,840
‐ Cool. ‐ Well, that
about covers it.

448
00:21:43,673 --> 00:21:45,740
But what if he really fine?

449
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:51,273
‐ Then all bets are off.
‐ Okay! Yes, yes, yes!

450
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,540
[indistinct chatter]

451
00:21:55,506 --> 00:21:58,273
‐ Overton! ‐ Miss Harper!

452
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,880
Khadijah!

453
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:05,046
You didn't finish
the job, Overton.

454
00:22:05,113 --> 00:22:06,980
Synclaire!

455
00:22:07,046 --> 00:22:10,913
Now, what kind of
handyman are you?

456
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,513
Mama!

457
00:22:20,813 --> 00:22:22,680
[phone ringing]

458
00:22:22,746 --> 00:22:25,246
(Synclaire) 'Hello, James,
Hunter, and James residence.'

459
00:22:25,313 --> 00:22:27,380
'Yes, this is Synclaire James.'

460
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,380
'Oh, thank you, but we
already subscribe.'

461
00:22:30,446 --> 00:22:32,613
'Yes, we get that one, too.'

462
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,380
'No, I'm really sorry
but we have no use'

463
00:22:34,446 --> 00:22:36,546
'for "Modern Bride"
at the moment.'

464
00:22:37,613 --> 00:22:41,213
'Yes, Mom, I've been flossing.'

465
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,156
(Overton) 'Now, see, girl, that's
just what I was talking about!'

466
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,446
(Synclaire) 'Ooh!'

467
00:22:44,513 --> 00:22:46,113
[extinguisher hissing]

468
00:22:48,213 --> 00:22:51,513
(Overton) 'Another burnt
bagel disaster averted.'

469
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,813
(Synclaire) 'Oh, Overton!'
