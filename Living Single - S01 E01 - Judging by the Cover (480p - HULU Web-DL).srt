your reader's attention?

345
00:16:18,552 --> 00:16:20,754
You're just tryin' to make
me forget you lost my cover.

346
00:16:21,922 --> 00:16:23,890
Maybe.

347
00:16:23,957 --> 00:16:26,927
So, uh, anybody seen Regine?

348
00:16:26,993 --> 00:16:29,730
She upstairs gettin' ready
to go out with Brad again.

349
00:16:29,796 --> 00:16:31,965
So what do you have against
the brother, anyway?

350
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,000
His wife.

351
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:36,469
You know, I dated a
married woman once.

352
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,338
‐ Really? ‐ No. I'm just lyin'.

353
00:16:38,404 --> 00:16:40,340
Tryin' to get attention again.

354
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,050
Whoo! Mm. Look at that dress.

355
00:16:50,116 --> 00:16:52,619
It has just a hint of I'm easy

356
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:54,454
with a tinge of I need a job.

357
00:16:54,521 --> 00:16:55,922
[laughs]

358
00:16:55,989 --> 00:16:59,225
So I see you all are
stayin' home again, hmm?

359
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:02,068
Oh, yes. We're all sittin'
around like, oh, I don't know

360
00:17:02,135 --> 00:17:04,370
wives whose husbands
are cheating on them

361
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:05,997
but, uh, don't let
that ruin your night.

362
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:08,742
You go on out now.
Have some fun.

363
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:11,512
Look, his marriage was
over before he met me

364
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:13,614
and he's leaving his wife.

365
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,883
You know, I should put you
on the cover of my magazine.

366
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,885
"Flavor's" fool of the year.

367
00:17:20,687 --> 00:17:22,656
I know that you don't
agree with my decision

368
00:17:22,723 --> 00:17:25,291
to keep seein' Brad,
but I gotta trust him.

369
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:28,061
I know that he is goin'
to leave his wife

370
00:17:28,128 --> 00:17:29,796
and then he's gonna marry me

371
00:17:29,863 --> 00:17:32,265
and we can put this
whole thing behind us.

372
00:17:32,332 --> 00:17:34,400
Why do you let this man
play you like this?

373
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:37,403
Word! Don't you
know it's all game?

374
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,540
I can take care of
myself, alright?

375
00:17:39,606 --> 00:17:42,609
Well, fine. If you
say so, Miss Girl.

376
00:17:42,676 --> 00:17:44,978
Put on your fake airs
and your fake lashes

377
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:47,648
and just tramp your fake
behind on out of here

378
00:17:47,714 --> 00:17:49,182
'cause Khadijah don't need ya.

379
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:52,052
Well, fine. I will. I'm gone.

380
00:17:53,486 --> 00:17:56,356
‐ She's stupid, man. ‐
I can't believe this.

381
00:17:58,825 --> 00:18:01,301
I forgot. Brad is pickin' me up.

382
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:06,507
Girl, you'd better be careful.
I hear that man got a wife.

383
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:22,422
You know, Regine, honey.

384
00:18:22,488 --> 00:18:24,424
I don't think he's coming.

385
00:18:25,992 --> 00:18:27,260
Shut up!

386
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:33,600
Mm. Chocolate, huh?

387
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:35,602
Brad never showed up, did he?

388
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:36,903
No, alright, Khadijah.

389
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,005
So just go ahead. Give
me what I got coming.

390
00:18:39,072 --> 00:18:40,774
Nah. Too easy.

391
00:18:43,043 --> 00:18:44,911
Why does this keep
happenin' to me?

392
00:18:44,978 --> 00:18:47,013
'Cause you keep lookin'
for someone to carry you.

393
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,916
‐ Well, what's wrong with that?
‐ They keep dropping your ass.

394
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:00,927
All I want is the best.

395
00:19:00,994 --> 00:19:04,304
I mean, I want a man that
knows that fine wine

396
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,940
doesn't come with
a twist‐off cap.

397
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:09,843
You know, I don't know how
you got to be so snooty.

398
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,412
You ain't but one generation out
the projects your damn self.

399
00:19:15,415 --> 00:19:17,584
So what? I'm not
supposed to want more?

400
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:19,953
Of course. You can
get it on your own.

401
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,589
You can do anything.
You're a woman.

402
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:24,357
Hear you roar!

403
00:19:27,928 --> 00:19:30,130
I'm agreeing with you.

404
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:32,332
Look. Regine, it's simple.

405
00:19:32,398 --> 00:19:34,835
You gotta start taking
care of yourself.

406
00:19:34,901 --> 00:19:36,770
I mean, put Regine first.

407
00:19:36,837 --> 00:19:39,005
Do what you need to do for you.

408
00:19:39,072 --> 00:19:42,442
Hmm. You're absolutely
right, Khadijah.

409
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:44,244
Mother always is.

410
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,679
[laughs]

411
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:48,682
You know, I think, uh, I think
I'm gonna go shoppin' tomorrow.

412
00:19:48,749 --> 00:19:51,417
Get my hair done.
Maybe buy some hair.

413
00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:58,424
Um, that's, that's not
exactly what I had in mind

414
00:19:58,491 --> 00:20:00,534
but I guess you
could start there.

415
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:03,436
The bottom line is

416
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:06,673
men are nothing but speed bumps
on the road to happiness.

417
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:09,910
‐ You're right. ‐ No, no.

418
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:13,046
I think they're more
like cheap pantyhose.

419
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:15,749
At the worst possible
moment, they run on you.

420
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:17,383
‐ 'Mm‐hmm.' ‐ 'Yes!'

421
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:20,554
You done hit it.
You done hit it.

422
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:21,855
But did you ever stop to think

423
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:24,625
about what the world would
be like without men?

424
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:27,160
A bunch of fat, happy
women and no crime.

425
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,162
[laughs]

426
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,474
I just came back
from the newsstand.

427
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,644
"Flavor" magazine is
completely sold out.

428
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,712
‐ Alright, girl! ‐
Congratulations!

429
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:47,948
Your featured article
was inspirin', girl.

430
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,415
Dope title, huh?

00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:52,152
"Dating Married Men, The
Sleeping Dog That Lies."

432
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:55,656
